# Online-Shopper-s-Purchasing-Intention

One Of the Most Important Project that I've worked on:
The data is about The People Intention of Purchasing Products on our website. It contains some details about the customers like how much time he/she spends on product related pages, what browser is he using and Is he on Working-day or Weekend. and so on:

#### The Project is Divided into Four Parts
1- (Exploratory Data Analysis)
Here I try to find the most valuable Plots that can tell information about the data Like
  - What is the most Common Website People use to enter our website
  - What is the most Common Operating System.
  - Do people tend to buy more in Weekends or Workingdays?

2- (Hypothesis Testing, Conditional Probability and Bayes' Theorem)
  - By The help of those two concepts I'm able to check if my hypotheses are correct or not let's say the data show that Old-Users tend to buy more than New-Users We can't plug-in this hypothesis to our Marketing Team Unless We test it so Here come Hypothesis testing to check if this hypothesis is true or not (it's not by the way: New-Users buy more).
  - Conditional Probabilities and Bayes' Theorem Tells us the probability of something heppens conditioned on something else: What is the probability that a customer buys if he enters the website from a Chrome Browser?

3- (Clustering Analysis)
- Clustering People into groups is a very important thing by using it we can tell the marketing team which people to focus on and which not.

4- ( Machine Learning Model )
- After Hanling Missing Values, Outliers, Imbalanced Data, Model Comparison and Parameters Tuning. I could have a Random Forest Classifier with Accuracy 99.7%

5- Power Bi
- Explanatory Data Analysis to show the most Important Insights that the Company should take in Consideration
